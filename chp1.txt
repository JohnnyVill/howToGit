testing the git repo

Order of creating a repository and commiting a file:
    1st: create the directory and files
    
    2nd: iniitilize this directory using 'git init' in cmd
    
    3rd: we have to track the files since they are currently untrack by using 'git add' in cmd
    extra: to check it that have any untracked files you can use 'git status' in cmd
            you can also see if the files are beign track usign the same cmd command
    
    4th: commit the files by using 'git commit -m "commit message" ' in cmd
    
    5th: you can use 'git log' to check the time the user did the commit
    
    6th: if you want to add multiple files at a time use 'git add .' in cmd

Managing changes in files/reverting changes locally (only works if file hasnt been commited/or added to staging area):
    git diff fileName: to compare the current changes in the file thats was added
                       and how the file was before these changes
    
    git checkout fileName: rollback the file to the last checkpoint it was commited in

Unstage a file:
    git restore --staged fileName

Adding our local repository into remote repository in github:
    1st: git remote add origin (paste url of remote repository that github provides)

    2nd: now we can push our local repository to the remote repository using 
          'git push -u origin main'
    extra: make sure the branch is called 'main' not master if called master use
            'git -M main' in cmd
